# Reconciliation System for Company Transactions

This project aims to develop a reconciliation system for comparing and reconciling company transactions with corresponding statements from banks or telecom providers. The system is designed to be customizable and can be adapted to various needs and requirements.

## Project Overview

The reconciliation system consists of the following components:

1. **File Inputs**: The system takes two input files in CSV format. The first file contains company transactions, while the second file contains the corresponding statements from banks or telecom providers.

2. **Data Parsing**: The system parses the CSV files and extracts relevant transaction details, such as transaction amounts, dates, and transaction identifiers.

3. **Data Matching**: The system matches transactions between the company transactions file and the statements file based on specific criteria, such as transaction amount and transaction identifier. This allows for identifying matching transactions and potential discrepancies.

4. **Reconciliation Process**: The system performs a reconciliation process to compare the matched transactions and identify any discrepancies or differences. It generates reconciliation reports highlighting the matched transactions, missing transactions, and potential errors.

5. **Customization**: The system is designed to be customizable to accommodate different reconciliation requirements. It provides options to configure matching criteria, reconciliation rules, and reporting formats based on specific business needs.

6. **Continuous Improvement**: The project aims to continually improve the reconciliation system by incorporating feedback, suggestions, and code ideas from users. This ensures that the system evolves and adapts to changing reconciliation needs.

## Future Enhancements

Here are some potential areas for future enhancements and improvements:

1. **User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly interface to facilitate easier configuration, input file selection, and result visualization.

2. **Automated Matching Algorithms**: Implement advanced matching algorithms, such as fuzzy matching, to improve the accuracy of transaction matching and reconciliation.

3. **Integration with Data Sources**: Enable integration with various data sources, such as APIs, databases, or cloud storage, to fetch transaction data directly, eliminating the need for manual file uploads.

4. **Exception Handling**: Enhance the system's exception handling capabilities to handle various file formats, data inconsistencies, and error scenarios gracefully.

5. **Reporting Enhancements**: Expand the reporting capabilities to include graphical representations, summary statistics, and customizable report templates.

6. **Audit Trail**: Implement an audit trail functionality to track changes, modifications, and user actions performed within the reconciliation system.
